### Response by ChatGPT 5 with Thinking

Nice — below is a **ranked list (top 20)** of ATS I estimate are *most used by small U.S. companies (under 500 employees)* when hiring software-engineering roles (backend, full-stack, data, etc.).

**Important note on methodology:** this ranking is an evidence-based estimate (not a single raw dataset) built from: frequency of appearance in SMB/startup ATS buyer guides and “best ATS for startups/small business” roundups; vendor positioning and pricing that target <500-employee orgs; and where possible mention/usage signals from recruiting-tool roundups and market articles. That combination is a practical proxy for *volume usage & hiring activity at small employers*. Sources used include Forbes Advisor, SelectSoftwareReviews, TechRadar, Arc.dev / startup roundups, and SMB buyer guides.

18. **Workstream** — popular for hourly/high-volume SMB hiring; some small tech firms use it for contractor/ops roles. ([Recruiters LineUp][6])
19. **Manatal** — lower-cost ATS gaining traction with small businesses. ([Recruiters LineUp][6])
20. **Comeet / Recruiterbox / GoHire (tie-candidates in this tail)** — a set of smaller, collaborative ATS tools that collectively see meaningful SMB usage (I group these as the small-vendor tail). ([Recooty][11], [Arc][4])

*--

##### Quick interpretation / caveats

* This ranking is an **SMB-weighted, evidence-based estimate** rather than a single definitive “usage count” (public datasets that break ATS adoption *by company size and by hiring volume for software engineers* are fragmented). I used multiple up-to-date SMB/startup buyer guides and market roundups to estimate which platforms actually see the most hiring activity at companies **under 500 employees**. ([SelectSoftware Reviews][2], [Arc][4])
* Job boards and platforms that include simple ATS flows (Indeed, ZipRecruiter, LinkedIn) show very high *volume* for small employers because they combine posting + basic applicant management; that’s why they appear at the top. ([TechRadar][3], [Forbes][1])
* Vendors like Greenhouse, Lever, and Ashby are especially common **in small tech-oriented companies** that hire backend/full-stack/data engineers; HRIS vendors (BambooHR, Freshteam) are common when small teams want HR + recruiting together. ([Startup Savant][5], [SelectSoftware Reviews][2])
